Introduction

This final project combines classical computer graphics theory and algorithms with modern
machine learning-based approaches. You are required to implement a computer graphics system
that has a foundation in classical rendering and extends it through AI-based graphics algorithms.
This project is completed in groups of 3–4 people.
Implementation can take the form of 3D or 2D rendering, graphics-based image processing, 3D generative models, neural rendering, or AI-assisted 3D reconstruction. Each group is
expected to combine classical computer graphics components such as rasterization, ray tracing, shading, illumination, geometry, lighting, or animation with AI-based graphics techniques
discussed in class such as diffusion-based models, neural radiance fields, gaussian splatting,
denoising, generative textures, geometry estimation, or other related techniques.
Each group is also expected to evaluate visual quality and performance according to technical
report best practices in the computer graphics field.

Project Scope

The final output of this project must involve the following components:

2.1

A. Classical Computer Graphics Techniques

You must implement at least one elements from the following list:
• Rasterization pipeline
• Ray tracing
• Volume rendering
• Classical lighting models (e.g., Phong, Blinn-Phong)
• Explicit or implicit geometry representation
• Geometry processing (mesh manipulation, subdivision, decimation)
• Texture mapping
• Classical animation techniques (e.g., keyframing, skeleton-based models)

2.2

B. AI-based Computer Graphics Extension

You must implement at least one element from the following list:
• Neural rendering (NeRF, Gaussian Splatting, etc.)
• Diffusion-based models for graphics generation
• Generative texture synthesis
• 3D reconstruction from 2D images via deep learning
• Geometry extraction using learned depth or normal prediction
• Deep Signed Distance Functions
• Learned motion synthesis
• Neural relighting or material estimation

Output Requirements

The output of this project must produce a computer graphics system with complexity similar
to the following examples:
1. 3D Virtual Environment: An interactive 3D scene with classical rendering enhanced by
neural techniques
2. Interactive 3D Editor: A tool for creating or manipulating 3D content using classical
and AI methods
3. Image-to-Geometry Converter: A system that reconstructs 3D geometry from 2D
images

4. Neural Relighting Engine: A system that can relight scenes or objects using learned
representations
5. Capture and Animation System: A pipeline for capturing real-world objects/scenes
and animating them
Your system should demonstrate clear integration between classical and AI-based techniques,
showing how they complement each other to achieve results superior to using either approach
alone.

Suggested Project Ideas

Each group is given freedom to develop their project idea. Here are some recommended example
ideas:

4.1

A. Re-creating Real Environments in 3D with Animation

Example pipeline:
• Capture photos of a scene to generate geometry using photogrammetry or neural reconstruction
• Apply shading and relighting using classical lighting models
• Animate characters or camera paths within the reconstructed environment

4.2

B. Classically Relight Your Selfies with 3D Gaussians

Example pipeline:
• Perform face segmentation from input images
• Model the face in 3D using 3D Morphable Models (3DMM)
• Apply relighting using classical illumination models
• Render the face using AI-based approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting

4.3

C. Simple Virtual Try-On System

Example pipeline:
• Capture 3D model of a person or object from images or video
• Generate new textures for the captured model using diffusion models
• Display video containing the same 3D person or object with different costumes or textures

5.2

B. Technical Report

Write a technical report following ACM SIGGRAPH or ACM Transactions on Graphics
format (6–8 pages) with the following structure:
Report Format Templates
Use the official ACM templates for your report:
• ACM SIGGRAPH: https://www.siggraph.org/preparing-your-content/
author-instructions/
• ACM TOG: https://dl.acm.org/journal/tog/author-guidelines
Download the LaTeX or Word template and follow the formatting guidelines carefully.
Required Sections
Your report must include all of the following sections. The specific content within each section
should be tailored to your project, but all sections must be present:

Important Guidelines

7.1

Use of External Resources

Weight
30%
30%
20%
20%

You are permitted to use external trained models or existing pipelines, provided that:
• You add original components or modifications
• You clearly document what is borrowed vs. what is your own contribution
• The integration itself demonstrates technical understanding
• Your report explicitly states what was used from external sources
Examples of acceptable use:
• Using a pre-trained NeRF model but adding custom lighting controls
• Using Stable Diffusion for texture generation within your custom pipeline
• Adapting an existing 3D reconstruction method to a new application
Unacceptable use:
• Running an existing system without modifications and claiming it as your work
• Minimal wrapper around existing code without substantial additions

7.2

Technical Recommendations

• Start early: Complex systems require significant development time
• Iterative development: Build a simple baseline first, then add features
• Version control: Use Git for collaboration and backup
• Regular testing: Test components individually before integration
• Documentation: Document as you code, not at the end
• Checkpoints: Save intermediate results and models

Submission Requirements

8.1

File Organization

Submit a single ZIP file named: <GROUP NAME>-FinalProject.zip

8.2

Submission Platform

• Platform: SCeLE
• Alternative: If file size exceeds limit, submit a link to Google Drive or similar cloud
storage (ensure permissions are set correctly)

9

Academic Integrity
• All code must be properly attributed if borrowed
• Plagiarism will result in severe penalties
• Collaboration between groups is not allowed
• External help must be acknowledged in the report

Good luck with your final project!
May your renders be beautiful and your gradients converge!
